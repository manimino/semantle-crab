Guess "giant", then "enemy", then "crab". 

[Then put numbers in here and hit solve.](https://semantle-crab.manimino.com/)

Triangulation. *d<sub>1</sub>* is "giant", *d<sub>2</sub>* is "enemy", *d<sub>3</sub>* is crab.†

Typically only one word will be at the exact intersection of all three distances.

### Can Semantle be solved in a less cheaty way?

[Yeah. It's tricky though!]((https://www.github.com/manimino/semantle-solver))
